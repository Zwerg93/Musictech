# musictech

This is a simple website to stream your own music
My goal is to make a application which you can clone and run localy on your own server. Its like a Nextcloud for mp3 or Music files

First release! I dockerised everything, and you can execute everything with "docker-compose up" in the musictech folder. The Docker-compose file will create the server, client and the Postgres image to start everything up- The application will run on localhost:4200 


# about

i created this project because i hatet all existing streaming apps. All of them were ugly, expensive or flooded with advertising. So i startet to develop 
this project for school, and startet do like the things I createt. So i started working on the app privately and add more and more features. In the end I want to have an application i actually want to use.
